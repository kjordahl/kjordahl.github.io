  	      My favorite recently read book was written over 40 years ago but just republished by @MtneersBooks. The Starship and The Canoe by Kenneth Brower is about Freeman Dyson and his son George Dyson.<br><a href="https://www.mountaineers.org/books/books/the-starship-and-the-canoe">https://www.mountaineers.org/books/books/the-starship-and-the-canoe</a>

  	      @MtneersBooks George Dyson himself went on to become a writer, first publishing his own book about his kayaks and their historical roots in the Aleut who built their vessels out of driftwood and seal skin. Beautifully illustrated but sadly out of print.<br><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/653285.Baidarka">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/653285.Baidarka</a>

  	      @MtneersBooks George Dyson later went on to publish what could be considered another companion piece to The Starship and the Canoe, about Project Orion which his father had worked on. Also out of print and hard to find.<br><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21243.Project_Orion">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21243.Project_Orion</a>
