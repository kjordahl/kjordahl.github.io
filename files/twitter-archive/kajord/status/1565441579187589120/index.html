  	      The most surprising thing about this is that @TheWinkApp is still in business. That their platform was down for *2 weeks* and the blog link in this post is broken, not at all surprising.

  	      Has anyone managed to jailbreak a Wink hub with open source software? There are some nice radios in that otherwise worthless device.
