  	      So, say you're a shareholder of a large electric car company whose CEO also happens to dabble in rockets. Maybe you were OK with that, but now he wants to buy another company and get into the social media business. Should you be concerned?

  	      Or maybe you're an investor in the most successful private rocket company in the world, whose CEO already had another full time job, and now he's taking on a third. Do you start to worry that his heart isn't really in your business?
