GeoPandas extends the pandas data analysis library to work with
geographic objects. File I/O, geometric operations, map projection
transformations and plotting are provided in a high level interface
that makes use of other libraries including Shapely and
Fiona. GeoPandas is ideal for interactive use with IPython, and
provides easy geospatial analysis and manipulation tools without a
need for complicated desktop GIS applications or spatial databases.
