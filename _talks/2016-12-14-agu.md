Planet operates dozens of 3U-class nanosatellites imaging the Earth at
3-5 m spatial resolution in visible and near-infrared
wavelengths. Currently acquiring over 10,000 km^2 daily, we are
progressing towards imaging the Earth at daily cadence in 2017.
Dynamically updated global mosaics are created by selecting,
color balancing, and seamlessly mosaicking millions of scenes to
create time slices at regular intervals. The data shown in these
mosaics present an unprecedented opportunity to observe the Earth at
better than 5 m spatial resolution and approaching daily temporal
resolution. Daily data at high spatial resolution opens up new
analysis techniques previously limited by the relatively
low-resolution of instruments such as MODIS and VIIRS.
