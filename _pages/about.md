This is Kelsey Jordahl's bio page.

I work in the Core Imagery software team at Planet. Planet operates
the largest private constellation of earth imaging satellites in the
world, processing terabytes of data every day. Prior to joining Planet
in 2015, I worked as a scientific software developer, working with
clients in finance, energy, government and academia and teaching the
Python programming language to scientists and engineers. I previously
taught physics at Marymount Manhattan College and did research in
marine geophysics. I earned a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (MIT) - Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI)
Joint Program in Oceanography and a B.S. in Physics from Eckerd
College.
