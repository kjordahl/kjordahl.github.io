This is Kelsey Jordahl's bio page.

I am a scientist and software developer, currently working at
Planet. Planet operates the largest private constellation of earth
imaging satellites in the world, processing terabytes of data every
day. Prior to joining Planet in 2015, I worked as a scientific
software developer and a geophysicist.

I am the founder of the [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org) project,
though no longer an active maintainer. When I can get away from the
computer, I like to spend time outdoors, in the mountains, on a bike,
or on skis.
