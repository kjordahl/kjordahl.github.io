This is Kelsey Jordahl's bio page.
I am currently Director of the Derived Data Products team at Planet. Planet operates the largest private constellation of satellites in the world, including over 150 earth observation satellites, and processes terabytes of data every day. Prior to joining Planet in 2015, I worked as a scientific software developer, working with clients in finance, energy, government and academia and teaching the Python programming language to scientists and engineers. I previously taught physics at Marymount Manhattan College and did research in marine geophysics. I earned a Ph.D. from the MIT-Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program in Oceanography and a B.S. in Physics from Eckerd College.
